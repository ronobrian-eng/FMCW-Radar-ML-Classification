# FMCW-Radar-ML-Classification

## 📘 Overview
This project implements a **software-only FMCW radar simulator** in **MATLAB** and combines it with a simple **machine learning classifier** to distinguish between three target types: **Human**, **Car**, and **Drone** using their Doppler / micro-Doppler signatures.

The project is designed as a compact RF + ML portfolio piece showcasing radar signal processing, feature engineering, and classification — all done in MATLAB.

## ⚙️ Features

### 🔹 FMCW Radar Signal Chain
- 77 GHz carrier frequency (typical automotive radar band)  
- 150 MHz sweep bandwidth  
- Linear FMCW chirp generation  
- Range FFT (fast-time processing)  
- Doppler FFT (slow-time processing)  
- Range–Doppler Map visualisation  
- Micro-Doppler-like spectrogram at a selected range bin  

### 🔹 Machine Learning Classification
- Synthetic classes: **Human**, **Car**, **Drone**  
- Velocity profiles generated to mimic each class:
  - Human: low speed, strong micro-motion
  - Car: higher average speed, smoother profile
  - Drone: moderate speed with oscillatory hovering motion
- RF-inspired features extracted from velocity:
  - Mean velocity  
  - Standard deviation of velocity  
  - Maximum absolute velocity  
  - Mean absolute derivative of velocity  
- Multi-class SVM classifier (`fitcecoc`) trained and evaluated  
- Prints overall classification accuracy in the MATLAB command window

## 📊 Results

### 1️⃣ Range–Doppler Map
The first figure shows the **Range–Doppler Map**, where each bright region corresponds to a simulated target at a particular range and radial velocity.

### 2️⃣ Micro-Doppler-Like Signature
At the strongest range bin, the script extracts the slow-time signal and computes a **spectrogram**, giving a micro-Doppler-like signature that reflects the velocity variations of the target over time.

### 3️⃣ ML Feature Space
The final figure shows the **feature space** (e.g., mean vs max velocity) with different classes labelled, giving intuition about how well the RF-inspired features separate Human, Car, and Drone motion.

| Feature Space (Human / Car / Drone) |
|-------------------------------------|

The script prints the **classification accuracy** in the MATLAB command window, giving a quick sense of how well the simple SVM model performs on the synthetic dataset.
